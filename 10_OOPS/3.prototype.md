# Prototype

## Javascript default behaviour is prototypal .Simply, it never give up on the query provided by the developer and start finding it layer by layer.It will stop the search when get the "null" value

### Things that are using prototypal behaviour

```text
1. .this keyword
2. classes
3. new keyword
4. prototypal inheritance
```

## Why can't we use "this" keyword in arrow function in javascript?

Arrow functions in JavaScript have a unique behavior when it comes to the this keyword. Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this context. Instead, they inherit this from the surrounding lexical context at the time they are defined. This behavior is known as "lexical scoping."

```javascript
const obj = {
  value: 42,
  regularFunction: function() {
    return this.value;
  },
  arrowFunction: () => {
    return this.value;
  }
};

console.log(obj.regularFunction()); // 42
console.log(obj.arrowFunction());   // undefined

```

## Lexical Scoping

```javascript
const obj = {
  value: 10,
  method: function() {
    const arrowFunc = () => {
      console.log(this.value); // 'this' is lexically scoped and refers to 'obj'
    };
    arrowFunc();
  }
};

obj.method(); // Logs: 10

```

In this case, the arrowFunc inside method captures the this value of method, which refers to obj. This is because arrowFunc is lexically scoped and does not create its own this.

## Summary

### Lexical Scoping

- The scope of variables is determined by their physical placement in the code.

### Functions

- Functions defined within another function can access the variables of the outer function due to lexical scoping.

### Arrow Functions

- They use lexical scoping for this, meaning they inherit this from their surrounding scope rather than having their own.

Lexical scoping is what makes closures and many other powerful features of JavaScript possible.
